      regional and 23 geomarket\n  management teams work to understand customer needs
      and coordinate delivery of reliable,\n  practical solutions that include the

      brand with a lofty objective:\n  to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary

      directly with consumers, we’re able to offer ultra-high-quality,\n  vintage-inspired
      frames for $95 including prescription lenses and shipping. We focus\n  on the
      bigger picture, too: social innovation is woven into the DNA of our company,\n
      \ and for every pair of glasses purchased, a pair is distributed to someone
      in need.\\r<br>\\n<br>\\nBecause\n  all work and no play makes a dull office,
      we fill our days with snacks, surprises,\n  pneumatic tubes, and, when appropriate,
      costumes. As a team member at Warby Parker,\n  you can also look forward to
      company outings, guest speakers, volunteering opportunities,\n  and brain-stimulating
      activities.\\r<br>\\n<br>\\nIn 2015, Fast Company named us the\n  #1 Most Innovative

      :description: "<p>FundersClub is the world's first online venture capital platform.
        It is built around a unique online marketplace that allows accredited investors
        to become equity holders in managed venture funds, which then fund pre-screened
        private companies. Each funded FundersClub startup benefits from the capital, the
        advice, and the professional networks of its associated venture fund, and are spared
        from the overhead of interfacing with a crowd of investors by receiving capital
        in a traditional venture capital fund format. Investors benefit from greater access
        to private investment opportunities, a more convenient investment process and the
        ability to diversify with relatively small amounts of capital. <br>\n<br>\nBacked
        by Y Combinator, First Round Capital, Spark Capital, Intel Capital, Draper, Andreessen

        <p>Founded in August of 2008 and based in San Francisco, California, Airbnb is a trusted community marketplace for people to list, discover, and book unique accommodations around the world — online or from a mobile phone. Whether an apartment for a night, a castle for a week, or a villa for a month, Airbnb connects people to unique travel experiences, at any price point, in more than 33,000 cities and 192 countries. And with world-class customer service and a growing community of users, Airbnb is the easiest way for people to monetize their extra space and showcase it to an audience of millions. <br>
        <br>
        No global movement springs from individuals. It takes an entire team united behind something big. Together, we work hard, we laugh a lot, we brainstorm nonstop, we use hundreds of Post-Its a week, and we give the best high-fives in town. Headquartered in San Francisco, we have satellite offices in Dublin, London, Barcelona, Paris, Milan, Copenhagen, Berlin, Moscow, São Paolo, Sydney, and Singapore.</p>

        <p>Google’s mission is to organize the world‘s information and make it universally accessible and useful. <br>
        <br>
        Since our founding in 1998, Google has grown by leaps and bounds. From offering search in a single language we now offer dozens of products and services—including various forms of advertising and web applications for all kinds of tasks—in scores of languages. And starting from two computer science students in a university dorm room, we now have thousands of employees and offices around the world. A lot has changed since the first Google search engine appeared. But some things haven’t changed: our dedication to our users and our belief in the possibilities of the Internet itself.</p>

        and get ranked based on their coding abilities.\t<br>\n<br>\nDeveloper Profile -
        HackerEarth uses its proprietary algorithm and data science to assess a programmer’s
        skill set by analyzing his/her publicly available coding data from sources like
        Github, Stackoverlfow etc. Combined with a candidate’s past work experience and
        education history it provides an accurate measure of candidate’s proficiency to
        the recruiter.\r<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAssessment Tool - HackerEarth’s assessment tool
        allows recruiter to save their countless developer hours, by automating the assessment
        process end to end. This allows people with little or no technical knowledge set

        the process. It is built for those looking to read news more efficiently: those
        commuting to work, waiting for an appointment, or simply wanting to catch up with
        the latest events. It saves time even during the process of selecting an article,
        since it can summarise the title into just one word and a thumbnail, or into only
        a picture, which is a unique way of choosing stories to read. It can additionally
        process any webpage, even those not from the built-in news sources and it will be

        is based on ‘Contactless Power’ technology that removes the need for individual

        data scientists and techies trying to make a difference in the world of small business
        financing.\r<br>\n<br>\n4 reasons to choose Lendingkart: <br>\n1. Our application
        process is 100% online - it takes just 15 minutes.\r<br>\n2. It requires minimum
        documentation (for e-commerce vendors we only take bank statements and VAT returns).\r<br>\n3.
        No Collateral or Net worth details required.\r<br>\n4. We disburse the loan money
        in just 3 days.\r<br>\n<br>\nUnlike banks and other NBFCs, we don't focus on old
        records such as Financial Statements &amp; Income Tax returns to evaluate a customer's
        credit worthiness. We focus on their current year's cash flows and business growth.
        We give a short term revolving credit line, which can be used any time to pay to
        suppliers, employees, taxes and other payments. Our effort is to make available
        working capital funds at the click of a button so that entrepreneurs can focus on
        their business instead of worrying about gaps in their cash-flows. We are currently
